# Inception Project

Welcome to the Inception Project! This project is part of the curriculum at 42 School and is designed to help understand and implement the fundamental concepts of system administration and virtualization. By the end of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to set up and manage a multi-service architecture using Docker.

## Project Overview

The Inception Project is focused on creating a small infrastructure composed of different services using Docker. I containerized various services and ensure they can communicate with each other. The main objectives are:

- Understand the basics of Docker and containerization.
- Set up a multi-service architecture.
- Manage and orchestrate containers.
- Implement networking between containers.
